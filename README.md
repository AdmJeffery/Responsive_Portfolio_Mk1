# Responsive_Portfolio_Mk1

This is my first responsive portfolio. The main purpose was to learn how to incoporate Bootstrap designs within a webpage while focusing on CSS as little as possible. 

The project consists of 3 webpages: an About Me page; a Portfolio page; and a Contact Me page.

The About me section gives a brief intro to who I am and why I am learning coding. At this point, it serves as a simply designed introduction with several links to my social media.

The Portfolio page is set up for me to create pictures and links associated with past and future projects. Currently, there are several placeholders on the page that will be updated as my education continues.

The Contact Me page serves as an avenue to message me personally. Currently, it is not linked up to my email, but it will be at a later date. This section probably was the most difficult, yet also the page I am most proud of. 

What I enjoyed most was learning how to create professional designs on a webpage. I've never be adverse to research, and finding little discoveries on how to make things work and appear as they should was truly an experience worth remembering.
